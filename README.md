# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions and coursework for **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**.

## Course Overview

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.

## Projects Structure

### [Week 0: Search](./0_Search)
*   **[Degrees](./0_Search/degrees)**: A program that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are, using Breadth-First Search.
*   **[Tic-Tac-Toe](./0_Search/tictactoe)**: A Tic-Tac-Toe AI that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

### [Week 1: Knowledge](./1_Knowledge)
*   **[Knights](./1_Knowledge/knights)**: An AI leveraging propositional logic to solve logic puzzles (Knights and Knaves).
*   **[Minesweeper](./1_Knowledge/minesweeper)**: An AI agent that plays Minesweeper using a knowledge base and inference.

### [Week 2: Uncertainty](./2_Uncertainty)
*   **[Heredity](./2_Uncertainty/heredity)**: An AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait using Bayesian Networks.
*   **[PageRank](./2_Uncertainty/pagerank)**: An AI that ranks web pages by importance using the PageRank algorithm (both sampling and iterative methods).

### [Week 3: Optimization](./3_Optimization)
*   **[Crossword](./3_Optimization/crossword)**: An AI that generates crossword puzzles using constraint satisfaction problems and backtracking search.

### [Week 4: Learning](./4_Learning)
*   **[Shopping](./4_Learning/shopping)**: A nearest-neighbor classifier to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.
*   **[Nim](./4_Learning/nim)**: An AI that teaches itself to play the game Nim through reinforcement learning (Q-Learning).

### [Week 5: Neural Networks](./5_Neural_Network)
*   **[Traffic](./5_Neural_Network/traffic)**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

### [Week 6: Language](./6_Language)
*   **[Parser](./6_Language/parser)**: An AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases using Context-Free Grammars.
*   **[Attention](./6_Language/attention)**: An AI that predicts a masked word in a text sequence using BERT's attention mechanism.
